## Installation 🛠️

Crawl4AI offers flexible installation options to suit various use cases. You can install it as a Python package or use Docker.

<details>
<summary>🐍 <strong>Using pip</strong></summary>

Choose the installation option that best fits your needs:

### Basic Installation

For basic web crawling and scraping tasks:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
```

By default, this will install the asynchronous version of Crawl4AI, using Playwright for web crawling.

👉 **Note**: When you install Crawl4AI, the setup script should automatically install and set up Playwright. However, if you encounter any Playwright-related errors, you can manually install it using one of these methods:

1. Through the command line:

   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

2. If the above doesn't work, try this more specific command:

   ```bash
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

This second method has proven to be more reliable in some cases.

---

### Installation with Synchronous Version

The sync version is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. If you need the synchronous version using Selenium:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai[sync]
```

---

### Development Installation

For contributors who plan to modify the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai.git
cd crawl4ai
pip install -e .                    # Basic installation in editable mode
```

Install optional features:

```bash
pip install -e ".[torch]"           # With PyTorch features
pip install -e ".[transformer]"     # With Transformer features
pip install -e ".[cosine]"          # With cosine similarity features
pip install -e ".[sync]"            # With synchronous crawling (Selenium)
pip install -e ".[all]"             # Install all optional features
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>🚀 <strong>One-Click Deployment</strong></summary>

Deploy your own instance of Crawl4AI with one click:

[![DigitalOcean Referral Badge](https://web-platforms.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/WWW/Badge%203.svg)](https://www.digitalocean.com/?repo=https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai/tree/0.3.74&refcode=a0780f1bdb3d&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge)

> 💡 **Recommended specs**: 4GB RAM minimum. Select "professional-xs" or higher when deploying for stable operation.

The deploy will:
- Set up a Docker container with Crawl4AI
- Configure Playwright and all dependencies
- Start the FastAPI server on port `11235`
- Set up health checks and auto-deployment

</details>

<details>
<summary>🐳 <strong>Using Docker</strong></summary>

Crawl4AI is available as Docker images for easy deployment. You can either pull directly from Docker Hub (recommended) or build from the repository.

---

### Option 1: Docker Hub (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull and run from Docker Hub (choose one):
docker pull unclecode/crawl4ai:basic    # Basic crawling features
docker pull unclecode/crawl4ai:all      # Full installation (ML, LLM support)
docker pull unclecode/crawl4ai:gpu      # GPU-enabled version

# Run the container
docker run -p 11235:11235 unclecode/crawl4ai:basic  # Replace 'basic' with your chosen version

# In case you want to set platform to arm64
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -p 11235:11235 unclecode/crawl4ai:basic

# In case to allocate more shared memory for the container
docker run --shm-size=2gb -p 11235:11235 unclecode/crawl4ai:basic
```

---

### Option 2: Build from Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai.git
cd crawl4ai

# Build the image
docker build -t crawl4ai:local \
  --build-arg INSTALL_TYPE=basic \  # Options: basic, all
  .

# In case you want to set platform to arm64
docker build -t crawl4ai:local \
  --build-arg INSTALL_TYPE=basic \  # Options: basic, all
  --platform linux/arm64 \
  .

# Run your local build
docker run -p 11235:11235 crawl4ai:local
```

---

### Quick Test

Run a quick test (works for both Docker options):

```python
import requests

# Submit a crawl job
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:11235/crawl",
    json={"urls": "https://example.com", "priority": 10}
)
task_id = response.json()["task_id"]

# Get results
result = requests.get(f"http://localhost:11235/task/{task_id}")
```
