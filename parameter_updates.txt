The file /docs/md_v2/api/parameters.md should be updated to include the new network and console capturing parameters. 

Here's what needs to be updated:

1. Change section title from:
```
### G) **Debug & Logging**
```
to:
```
### G) **Debug, Logging & Capturing**
```

2. Add new parameters to the table:
```
| **`capture_network_requests`** | `bool` (False) | Captures all network requests, responses, and failures during the crawl. Available in `result.network_requests`. |
| **`capture_console_messages`** | `bool` (False) | Captures all browser console messages (logs, warnings, errors) during the crawl. Available in `result.console_messages`. |
```

These changes demonstrate how to use the new network and console capturing features in the CrawlerRunConfig.
